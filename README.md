# SEM2

This the current working build of the *Structured Event Memory* (SEM) model, originally presented in Franklin et al., 2019 [[link](http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/Franklin20.pdf)].  For the simulations that ocompany the paper, please see our earlier github repository [https://github.com/ProjectSEM/SEM](https://github.com/ProjectSEM/SEM), which is maintained for archival purposes.

## Tutorials and Demonstrations
The tutorials run in Google Colab and don't require local installation.  These will download and install the SEM2 package

## Installation Requirements
This package has been tested in Python v3.6 and relies on tensorflow. 

To install, use the command: 
`pip install git+https://github.com/nicktfranklin/SEM2`

SEM can then be used in python as a package.  To import SEM:
`>>import sem`


The demonstrations require addtional plotting libraries (found in the requirements.txt file). These can be installed via
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
